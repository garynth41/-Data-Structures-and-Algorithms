# -Data-Structures-and-Algorithms:
This repository will document my training in Data Structures and Algorithms. Algorithmic Toolbox, ! The class covers basic algorithmic techniques and ideas for computational problems arising frequently in practical applications: sorting and searching, divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, and many others. I learned how to sort and search data, how to break a large problem into pieces and solve them recursively; how to pack your knapsack using greedy algorithms, and how to search for similarities between genes using dynamic programming. I practiced solving computational problems, designing new algorithms, and implementing them as efficient software tools.
